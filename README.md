# Craigslist Cars+Trucks Analysis

This application utilizes a custom-made csv file to analyze roughly 700k entries scraped from Craigslist cars+trucks data.

## What's in the Data?

craigslistVehicles.csv contains the following columns:

* Listing URL (unique)

* Craigslist Region (categorical)

* Price (integer)

* Year (integer)

* Manufacturer (categorical)

* Make/Model (string)

* Condition (categorical)

* Cylinders (categorical)

* Fuel (categorical)

* Odometer (integer)

* Title Status (categorical)

* Transmission (categorical)

* Vehicle Identification Number (string)

* Drive (categorical)

* Size (categorical)

* Type (categorical)

* Color (categorical)

* Image URL (unique)

* State (categorical)

* County (categorical)

* Average Location Temperature (integer)

Users are not required to fill out every possible category when listing their vehicle, so this dataset contains holes in every column except for Listing URL, Craigslist Region and Price. Year contains a negligible amount of blank entries (less than .01%)
